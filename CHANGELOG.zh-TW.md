## Version 0.89.0

### Action Needed

#### Item Quality

We have (re)added item quality data points to Weapons, Cyberdecks, etc. we have migrated items with a best effort (checking for poor/exellent in item names/descriptions) but this migration may not catch 100% of items.

Please manually review any items in your world/custom compendia/on actors that may need to be adjusted.

#### Skill Types

##### Removing Old Generic Skills

We have removed the old (incorrect) generic skills `Science`, `Play Instrument`, `Martial Arts`, `Local Expert`, and `Language` from being added to new Characters/Mooks and We have added new system compendia for `Skills (Languages)`, `Skills (Local Expert)`, `Skills (Martial Arts)`, `Skills (Science)`, and `Skills (Science)` which you can use to populate these specific skills for new actors.

As we do not want to lose any of your data we have not removed these Skills from your actors, we have instead made them deletable so you can add the add the correct specific skills and remove the old ones from character sheets as in your own time.

##### Modifying existing Specific Skills

For some functionality in the system we have added a `Skill Type` to each skill, while we have made a best effort to migrate all skills to the correct type there may be some instances where we were unable to detect the correct Skill Type of a skill. If you have any actors with custom skills for `Science`, `Play Instrument`, `Martial Arts`, `Local Expert`, and `Language` you may need to set it's Skill Type of the skill manually in that skill's Settings page. You can follow the process on the [wiki page](https://github.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/wiki/System-Documentation-Items-Skills#settings-tab).

#### Weapons Ignoring Armor

We have added the ability to allow weapons to ignore a percentage of armor or armor under a certian SP. We have migrated all melee weapons to include the new datapoints to ignore 50% armor by default.

If your players or mooks have any weapons that ignore a different percentage or armor under a certian SP that is not 50%/0SP then you will need to update these manually (or replace from a copy in the system compendia).

#### Get EMP'd Macro

If you have imported the `Get EMP'd Macro` you will need to delete the copy in your world and re-import it from the `Other/Macros` Compendium as we have updated this Macro.

### Action Needed

Our v11 Migrations of Active Effects introduced a bug where modifiers to STATs (and only STATs). Caused them to be multiplied by 3. Caused them to be multiplied by 3.

For example, if you had the Grafted Bone and Muscle Lace (BODY +2) on an actor with a base BODY of 6, instead of having a BODY of 8, the actor would now have a BODY of 12.

Unfortunately we cannot revert this automatically so you will need to fix these issues manually. Either restore from a pre-`0.88` backup and remgirate or adjust the actors back. This affects all Characters/Mooks who had STAT modifiers.

\*\*If you are currently migrating from a version prior to `0.88`, the above does not apply (as the migration script has been fixed).

### New Features

- The Changelog is now a Journal allowing:
  - The entire Changelog to be shown
  - Re-opening at any time

## Version 0.88.1

### Action Needed

**WARNING**: IF YOU HAVE UPDATED FROM `0.88.0`/FOUNDRY V11, THIS WAS WRONG (but not your fault). YOU NEED TO ROLL BACK TO THE BACKUP YOU MADE / FOUNDRY V10, THEN UPDATE TO THIS VERSION. AGAIN, **ROLL BACK TO FOUNDRY V10 AND YOUR BACKUP THAT YOU MADE IN CPR `0.87.6`**, THEN UPDATE DIRECTLY TO `V0.88.1`. Come to the discord if you are confused.

### Bug Fixes

- Actually fix a (Foundry) bug where unlinked tokens were losing all of their items.

## Version 0.88.0

### Action Needed

We have renamed all Compendia in the system utilizing the new Compendium Folders feature which has meant some changes behind the scenes which mean the pack names themselves have changed.

This means any instances where you have dragged an item from a compendium into a text field like an Item Description or Journal entry which created a link to the item is now referencing a broken item. Unfortunately this would be very complex and fragile to migrate so we have not provided migrations for this. You can fix it by editing the document and dragging and dropping the item from the compendium again.

### Bug Fixes

Fix broken migrations

## Version 0.87.0

### Action Needed

#### New Discord

We have moved Discord server! If you need any help with this release, want to help with future releases, or just want to join our community we can now be found in our new [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TsvcZUEtbJ). We hope to see you there!

#### Ammo Modifies Weapon Damage

Ammo can now modify weapon damage / autofire maximums. This supports ammo which overrides the weapon damage (e.g. shotgun shells), ammo which does no damage (e.g. sleep ammo), and ammo which adds/subtracts from the weapon damage (junk ammo). Similarly, ammo can modify the autofire maximum of the base weapon (junk ammo). For example, shotgun shells automatically roll 3d6 damage instead of the shotgun's base damage. Ammo can now modify weapon damage / autofire maximums. For example, shotgun shells automatically roll 3d6 damage instead of the shotgun's base damage. We made a best attempt at migrating relevant items on actors, but if you've changed the name of compendia items or have homebrew items with this functionality, those items will need to be updated manually.

#### Situational Modifiers

Effects with situational modifiers have been given the appropriate settings on all compendium items, but you will have to manually update them on items that already exist on actors. See New Features -&#062; Roll Modifiers section of Changelog for more details. See New Features -> Roll Modifiers section of Changelog for more details.

#### Electronic Items

We have migrated all Gear items provided by our Compendia to support `isElectronic` but you will need to update any homebrew items manually if you want them to support this new data point.

#### CSS Themes / Rewrite

Due to a large amount of changes to the way we use CSS and having to overwrite a number of Foundry CSS defaults any modules which also touch Foundry CSS may be incompatible or have conflicts with our CSS changes.

For example if you are using [Ernies Modern UI](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ernies-modern-layout) and the system provided Dark Mode theme then Ernies needs to be configured to use Dark Mode as well.

### New Features

#### Improved Dialogues

- All dialogues have been given new styling and have been converted to a new system called CPRDialog
- This will allow for more responsive dialogues with complex logic, the first use of which is in new roll dialogues:
  - The UI for roll dialogues has been improved and brought more in-line with the style of our system
  - Dialogues are now responsive sheets and can change depending on inputs
  - No more detective work: A tool tip (both in dialogues and on roll cards) displays where every bonus/penalty on your roll comes from
  - Toggle situational modifiers from active effects, upgrades, and roles right from the dialog
  - Toggle the core situational modifiers on page 130 of the core rule book from a drop-down menu
  - Add any additional modifiers to the roll as needed

#### Roll Modifiers

- New Active Effect key: All Actions - Modify all actions with a single active effects key. Found in the 'Miscellaneous' category in the Active Effect configuration window. Found in the 'Miscellaneous' category in the Active Effect configuration window.
- Each modifier on an effect can be toggled as Situational. Situational modifiers are ones that only apply in certain situations. Situational modifiers can also be toggled On By Default. Situational modifiers are ones that only apply in certain situations. Situational modifiers can also be toggled On By Default.
  - For example, the TeleOptics cyberware adds a +1 to certain attacks when the target is greater than 51m away. Since we do not want this bonus applying all the time, it is toggled Situational. This way, we can apply it in roll dialogues with one click, only as needed. For example, the TeleOptics cyberware adds a +1 to certain attacks when the target is greater than 51m away. Since we do not want this bonus applying all the time, it is toggled Situational. This way, we can apply it in roll dialogues with one click, only as needed. If your character is a sniper and almost always uses the TeleOptics bonus, you can also toggle the Situational modifier as Default On. This way, the modifier is applied by default, but it can be toggled off during the few times your character moves to closer range. This way, the modifier is applied by default, but it can be toggled off during the few times your character moves to closer range.
- Modifiers to rolls from Role Abilities also have Situational (and On By Default) options
- Modifiers to rolls from item Upgrades also have Situational (and On By Default) options
  - Note: effects with situational modifiers have been given the appropriate settings on all compendium items but you will have to manually update them on items that already exist on actors
- Known Issue:
  - Active Effects on Stats behave differently than all others. Active Effects on Stats behave differently than all others. Because of this, modifiers on Stat effects currently cannot be toggled Situational. This will be fixed in a future release. This will be fixed in a future release.

#### CSS Themes

We have added the functionality for system specific themes. We have added the functionality for system specific themes. This allows us to ship a few default themes (dark mode!). You can configure this in the <code>Settings &gt; Cyberpunk RED - CORE</code> section. You can configure this in the `Settings > Cyberpunk RED - CORE` section.

  - Reminder: if using any roll modifiers and the card description modifier (#), the card description modifier must be the last one used on the line. This has always been the case, just calling it out here as this now adds an additional modifier. This has always been the case, just calling it out here as this now adds an additional modifier.

  - If a user owns multiple tokens of either Character or Mook, a warning message is now thrown when the user clicks the ruler to select a DV telling them they need to select the token before use
  - If a user owns multiple tokens of either Character or Mook and has no tokens selected, when they use the ruler, a message is displayed below the distance advising the user to select the token of the DV they want to see

- \#671 - Fixed BlackICE tokens getting corrupted when they were first created because the calls to update the token were passing bad data

Additionally, when reloading, it would only take the bullet difference from the other bullet type instead of the full amount to load the weapon. This could cause problems when attempting to use that weapon as the bullet type is unknown. Additionally, when reloading, it would only take the bullet difference from the other bullet type instead of the full amount to load the weapon.

## Version 0.86.1 | Date: 2023-02-05

### Bug Fixes

- \#683 - Dragging a World Item which has another World Items installed in it and THAT item also has another world item installed in it (Cyberarm->Cyberdeck (Hardwired)->Cyberdeck) results in two cyberdecks being created on the actor. This would exponentiate every level of installation if there were more.
- Add text for missing localized string `CPR.messages.installInvalidType`
- \#686 - Installing a secondary weapon as a weapon upgrade does not show that upgrade in the Fight Tab
- \#693 - The stripHTML() Handlebar helper fails if the passed HTML contains a percentage sign.
- \#691 - Actors stored in compendiums and dragged out into worlds were losing information on any items that were installed.
- Fixed the ability to decrement REZ of a running program in the NET tab
- \#692 - Code accidentally added `programs` instead of `cyberware` for owned cyberware on existing actors. This fix adds `cyberware` as it should have been however we can't know if `programs` was a valid entry for a world, so we are not removing that. It does not impact anything and a GM can manually remove `programs` from an owned piece of cyberware via the item settings if needed.

### Changes

- When `Debug Elements in UI` is enabled on an item with other installed items in it, the installed items will have their UUID's displayed to help troubleshooting.

## Version 0.86.0 | Date: 2023-01-21

### Release Specific Notes

If you're a GM and you linked Black-ICE items to tokens on the canvas, you might have noticed that the description would not transfer. We fixed this for new linkages created (issue #623), but for any created since the last release, you'll have to copy the description over if you want it. We fixed this for new linkages created (issue #623), but for any created since the last release, you'll have to copy the description over if you want it.

We have added the ability for all types of Cyberware to be weapons. This means we have removed the Weapons that duplicated this functionality from the Weapons Compendium. We have added the ability for all types of Cyberware to be weapons. This means we have removed the Weapons that duplicated this functionality from the Weapons Compendium. This should not affect already made characters but if you want to streamline your Character/Mook Sheets you can remove the old Cyberware and Weapon items and replace with the new ones to access the new functionality.

In this release we revamped the underlying code which allowed the installation of items (Cyberware, Programs, Upgrades) into a more universal system. In doing this, it removed the previous limitation that only owned items can be upgraded. In this release we revamped the underlying code which allowed the installation of items (Cyberware, Programs, Upgrades) into a more universal system. In doing this, it removed the previous limitation that only owned items can be upgraded. This now allows GM's to pre-create custom upgraded items in the world and use them as needed in their games. More details of the new system and these expanded capabilities can be seen in the CHANGELOG. More details of the new system and these expanded capabilities can be seen in the CHANGELOG.

If you have any of these items in your world and you changed the name to be something other than what is in the Compendium (ie changed a `Skill Chip` name to be `Perception Skill Chip`), you will need to manually update these items to ensure they are accurate per Rules as Written:

- Any `Memory chips` and `Skill chips` should have their size set to 1 (was 0 for the previous system)
- Any renamed `Chipware Socket` should allow both `Upgrades` and `Cyberware` to be installed into them and their slot count should be set to 1

In testing the new system, it occurred to us that under the previous system, it was possible to accidentally install too many items into another item. For instance, an actor may have too many Fashionware items installed (more than 7). In testing the new system, it occurred to us that under the previous system, it was possible to accidentally install too many items into another item. For instance, an actor may have too many Fashionware items installed (more than 7). If your world contains items/actors that have too many items installed, a warning banner will be displayed during migration to notify you and there will also be a message in the Console providing the same information. Those items will not allow you to install anything additional into them. You can correct these by accessing the item in your world and uninstalling some of the items. Those items will not allow you to install anything additional into them. You can correct these by accessing the item in your world and uninstalling some of the items.

We **HIGHLY** recommend that when migration is completed, you **ALWAYS** check the console to ensure you did not miss any important messages about your world. Additional details can be found [here](https://github.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/wiki/Release-Information-migrations)

As such if you are using the Critical Injuries unmodified from the RED Corebook you can delete the previously imported "Critical Injuries (Head)" and "Critical Injuries (Body)" items as well as the "Critical Injury Tables" and "DV Rolltables" Roll Table

If you are using modified Critical Injuries please check out [this](https://github.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/wiki/System-Documentation-Items-Critical-Injuries#configuring-home-brew-injuries) Wiki article on how to use Homebrew Injuries. The same process can also be used with Homebrew DV Tables following this [Wiki](https://github.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/wiki/System-Documentation-DV-Tables#configuring-home-brew-dv-tables) article.

  - When a migration failed for any reason, on the next run through it could corrupt upgraded items

  - An Active Effect has a "usage" associated with it on an item. This affects when the effect will be applied. Examples are when carried, when equipped, toggling it on/off yourself or always on. Some specialized ones exist too: Cyberware allows for "when installed." More may be added in the future. This affects when the effect will be applied.

    - Black ICE Rez numbers are synchronized between the Cyberdeck Rezzed section and the associated Black ICE Token
    - GM Only Enhancement: When using the "Character Sheet" Sheet for Mooks, GM's have added functionality in the Rezzed Section:
      - Ability to execute Black ICE attack, damage and defense rolls
      - Ability to decrement REZ
    - Black ICE Actors unassociated with a Netrunner have had functionality added to them to quickly configure them using Black ICE Program Items
      - If a player opts to do this configuration, it further enables the ability to roll Damage from the Black ICE Actor
        - In a later release, we may decouple this and allow the ability to configure damage right on the Black ICE Actor
  - Cyberdeck Loading Requirement
    - Actors must own the Cyberdeck + Programs to install onto the Cyberdeck. ie inability to pre-load the Cyberdeck with programs before adding to an Actor. This is due to the direct relationship of the Program Items and the Cyberdeck. ie inability to pre-load the Cyberdeck with programs before adding to an Actor. This is due to the direct relationship of the Program Items and the Cyberdeck.

### Changes

- Setting the autofire maximum multiplier on an item will now be taken into account when rolling damage for autofire damage rolls. For weapons defined in the core rules (SMG, H.

If you set the multiplier in the roll dialog to a value higher than the allowable value, it will default to the maximum allowable multiplier. For weapons defined in the core rules (SMG, H.

  - Even better, once you have critical injury tables, you can roll right from the character sheet and it will automatically add a randomized critical injury.
- Wound State penalties automatically apply as mods on the roll (e.g. if the token is Seriously Wounded all actions will automatically have a -2 penalty)
- You can now change the amount of ammo in a weapon's clip right from the fight tab. In addition, you can type "+X" or "-Y" (where X and Y are numbers) into the input and it will perform the math. In addition, you can type "+X" or "-Y" (where X and Y are numbers) into the input and it will perform the math.
- Mook sheet introduced. Please use [issue #181](https://github.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core/issues/181) to suggest improvements or point out rough edges.
- Added "Source" field to item sheets to keep track of where items came from (e.g. Core Rules Pg. 351)
- "Thrown Weapon" is now a weapon type and "Athletics" is now a weapon skill for throwing grenades, etc. Weapons that use the athletics skill also use DEX as the stat, which is consistent with the rules.

### UI/UX

- Implemented a chat command “/red” which will roll 1d10 and explode on a 10 or negatively explode (implode?) on a 1. Rolls of the form “/red+X”, “/red-X”, and “/red XdY” are also supported (though there are no dice icons if Y isn’t a 6 or a 10).
- Macros can now be made for weapons, skills, journal entries and actors by dragging and dropping to the macro bar. Weapon macros can be easily edited to roll for damage, aimed shots, autofire, and suppressive fire. Weapon macros can be easily edited to roll for damage, aimed shots, autofire, and suppressive fire.
- Improvement Points now trackable and exist on the front of the character sheet, underneath Humanity.
- Eurobucks tracked in the gear tab.
- Can now view details of installed cyberware in ‘read-only’ mode.
- Being able to edit installed cyberware causes issues so the original fix was to make it so that installed cyberware could not be edited.

This had the unintended consequence that you could no longer click on the item to see its description if you wanted to reference how it worked. This solves that issue.
- System setting to allow skipping of the roll dialogue. This basically inverts the function of ctrl-click. System setting to allow skipping of the roll dialogue. This basically inverts the function of ctrl-click. This rolls default values on a regular click and brings up the roll modification dialogue on ctrl-click.
- Early implementation for keeping track of critical injuries.
- New glyphs/buttons for autofire and suppressive fire.
- Death saves are now rollable, trackable, and relate to critical injuries.
- Added the option to apply no humanity loss on installation of cyberware. This is useful if the user realizes a mistake after installation. They can uninstall, edit the item and reinstall without having to worry about fixing humanity loss afterwards. Also useful for reinstallation of items like Skill Chips and extra cyberarms for the quick-change mounts. This is useful if the user realizes a mistake after installation. They can uninstall, edit the item and reinstall without having to worry about fixing humanity loss afterwards. Also useful for reinstallation of items like Skill Chips and extra cyberarms for the quick-change mounts.

- Fixed alt-text localization for critical injuries section.
- When changing the ammo types on an owned weapon, a race condition was occurring which was intermittently over-writing what the proper value of ammoVariety should be so setting compatible ammo would sometimes just fail. Re-ordered the way things are done and this has resolved this issue. Re-ordered the way things are done and this has resolved this issue.
- Vehicles now correctly display Structural Damage Points (SDP) instead of the erroneous spd.
- Fix for the inability to set compatible ammo for an unowned weapon.
- Fixed a bug where choosing to roll for humanity loss when installing cyberware wouldn’t work.
- Fix for humanity loss looping back and subtracting from the maximum when dropping below 0 upon cyberware installation.

For example, if you opened the sheet and collapsed category 1, Closed the sheet, Opened the sheet, Category 1 is still collapsed. All Good. Change anything (Pin something, change a skill level) Category 1 would instantly expand. For example, if you opened the sheet and collapsed category 1, Closed the sheet, Opened the sheet, Category 1 is still collapsed. All Good.
